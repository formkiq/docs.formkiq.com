FormKiQ-Core was built using Java and JavaScript languages. In order to build from source you will need to install the development tools listed below.

**Required Development Tools**

* [JDK 11+](https://openjdk.java.net)
* [Gradle 6.7+](https://gradle.org)
* [NodeJS 6+](https://nodejs.org)
* [Docker 3.0.0+](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [AWS CLI 2.1+](https://aws.amazon.com/cli)
* [AWS SAM 1.15+](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
* [JQ 1.6+](https://stedolan.github.io/jq)
* [Box 5.2+](https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com)
* [YQ 3.4+](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)

**Running Build**

FormKiQ-Core uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as the main build tool. 

To compile:

```
./gradlew clean build
```

Building configuration is controlled through the `gradle.properties` file located in the root folder.

**Gradle parameters**

```
# gradle.properties
#
# testregion - the name of the AWS Region to deploy to (us-east-1,us-east-2,etc)
# testappenvironment - the name of the FormKiQ App Environment (test,prd,dev)

# testprofile - the name of the AWS CLI profile (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html)
# testadminemail - an email address that administration account will be setup under
#
```

`testregion` & `testappenvironment` are required for the `./gradlew build` task.

After a successful build all the artifacts will be placed in the build/distributions/formkiq-core/formkiq-core-${version}.zip.

# Costs

FormKiQ was created using [serverless technology](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless). This means that there are no servers to manage; everything is managed by AWS. All AWS services FormKiQ uses have pay-per-usage billing. You can start using FormKiQ with very little cost.

In fact, AWS provides a [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free) to all AWS accounts. This means that some AWS services you can use for **free**, assuming you are able to stay within the usage limits. Below is the list of services FormKiQ uses and their approximate usage costs, so give you an idea on how much it costs to run FormKiQ. (All costs in USD)

# S3 Backup Strategy

## Overview

Amazon S3 provides enterprise-grade storage with:
- 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability
- 99.99% availability
- Built-in redundancy across multiple Availability Zones
- Automatic data replication

While S3's native reliability is robust, FormKiQ implements additional backup strategies to protect against:
- Accidental deletions
- Data corruption
- Intentional data removal
- Regional outages

## Default Protection: S3 Versioning

FormKiQ enables S3 versioning by default for all buckets, providing:
- Preservation of all object versions
- Near real-time protection against deletions
- Immediate version restoration capability
- Complete change history

## Enhanced Protection Strategies

### 1. Cross-Region Replication (CRR)

Automatically replicate bucket data across AWS regions.

**Best For:**
- Regional disaster recovery
- Geographic redundancy
- Compliance requirements
- Multi-region availability

**Implementation:**
1. Enable versioning on source/destination buckets
2. Configure CRR through AWS Console or CLI
3. Set up replication rules:
   - Object filters
   - Storage class selection
   - Replication time control
4. Monitor replication metrics:
   - Replication latency
   - Bytes pending
   - Operations pending

**Benefits:**
- Automatic disaster recovery
- Compliance adherence
- Regional failover capability
- Reduced latency for multi-region access

### 2. AWS Backup Integration

Centralized backup management for S3 and other AWS services.

**Best For:**
- Multi-service environments
- Automated backup scheduling
- Compliance requirements
- Unified backup management

**Implementation:**
1. Create backup plans in AWS Backup
2. Define:
   - Backup frequency
   - Retention periods
   - Resource selection
3. Configure:
   - Backup windows
   - Lifecycle policies
   - Cross-account backup

**Benefits:**
- Centralized management
- Automated scheduling
- Policy compliance
- Cross-service integration

## Recovery Procedures

### Version Recovery

**Use Case:** Restore accidentally modified or deleted objects

**Steps:**
1. Access S3 bucket in AWS Console
2. Enable version display
3. Locate desired version
4. Choose recovery method:
   - Copy version
   - Download version
   - Remove delete marker

**Performance:**
- RTO: Immediate
- No data transfer fees between versions
- Instant accessibility

**Limitations:**
- Requires prior versioning
- Storage costs for versions
- Manual version selection

### Cross-Region Recovery

**Use Case:** Regional outage mitigation

**Steps:**
1. Access destination bucket
2. Verify replicated data
3. Choose recovery approach:
   - Direct access
   - Reverse replication
   - Bulk transfer

**Performance:**
- RTO: Minutes to hours
- Dependent on data volume
- Affected by replication lag

**Limitations:**
- Asynchronous replication
- Cross-region transfer costs
- Replication configuration required

### AWS Backup Recovery

**Use Case:** Systematic backup restoration

**Steps:**
1. Open AWS Backup console
2. Select backup point
3. Configure restore:
   - Target location
   - Object selection
   - Restore options

**Performance:**
- RTO: Minutes to hours
- Based on dataset size
- Parallel restoration capable

**Limitations:**
- Recovery time varies with size
- Restore location flexibility
- Service quotas apply

## Best Practices

1. **Strategy Implementation**
   - Align with business requirements
   - Consider compliance needs
   - Balance cost vs. recovery speed

2. **Monitoring**
   - Track version counts
   - Monitor replication status
   - Review storage metrics

3. **Testing**
   - Regular recovery drills
   - Version restoration tests
   - Cross-region failover practice

4. **Cost Optimization**
   - Version lifecycle policies
   - Storage class transitions
   - Replication rules review

5. **Documentation**
   - Recovery procedures
   - Configuration changes
   - Test results

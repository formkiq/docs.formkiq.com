# S3 Backup

## Introduction
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is designed to provide highly reliable and redundant storage for critical data. S3 automatically replicates data across multiple devices and facilities within a region, ensuring **99.999999999% (11 9's) durability** of objects over a given year. With its **built-in redundancy** and ability to store data across multiple Availability Zones (AZs), S3 ensures high availability and protection against hardware failures, providing **99.99% availability**. 

This backup and restore policy outlines additional procedures to complement S3â€™s reliability and redundancy, ensuring business continuity and quick recovery in case of accidental data loss, corruption, or intentional deletions. The policy also addresses strategies for long-term data archiving and lifecycle management for optimizing costs while maintaining data durability.


## S3 Versioning

By default FormKiQ configures S3 buckets to have S3 versioning enabled. Versioning allows for the preservation of, retrieval, and restoration of every version of every object stored in an S3 bucket. This allows for near real-time protection against accidental deletions or overwrites and gives the ability to restore specific versions immediately.

## Additional Backup Strategies

### Cross-Region Replication (CRR)

Cross-Region Replication (CRR) automatically replicates S3 bucket data to another region.

#### When to Implement
  - To protect data from regional outages or disasters.
  - For compliance with geographical data storage regulations that require data to be stored in multiple locations.

#### Why to Implement

CRR provides disaster recovery capabilities and ensures data is available in a different region in case of regional failures or major outages.

#### How to Implement
  1. Enable Versioning on both the source and destination buckets.
  2. Set up CRR in the AWS Management Console or via the AWS CLI.
  3. Monitor replication status to ensure successful data transfer between regions.

### AWS Backup

AWS Backup is a centralized backup solution that supports automated backup and restore for S3 buckets.

#### When to Implement
  - For managing backups across multiple AWS services and resources in a unified manner.
  - To automate the backup process for S3, ensuring regular and consistent snapshots of your data.

#### Why to Implement

AWS Backup simplifies the process of managing and automating backups across different services and ensures compliance with backup policies for S3 and other AWS resources.

#### How to Implement
  1. Configure backup plans in AWS Backup, specifying the S3 buckets and frequency of backups.
  2. Schedule automatic backups based on your RPO requirements.
  3. Define retention policies within AWS Backup to control the duration for which backups are kept.

## Restoring from Backups

### Restoring Using S3 Versioning

Use versioning to restore previous versions of objects that have been accidentally deleted or overwritten.

#### How to Restore

* Navigate to the S3 bucket in the AWS Management Console.
* Enable **Show Versions** to display all object versions.
* Identify the version you want to restore.
* Copy or download the specific object version, or set the desired version as the latest by removing the "Delete Marker" (if deleted).

**RTO**: Immediate, depending on the size of the object.
**Limitations**: Only available if Versioning is enabled on the bucket before the deletion or overwrite occurred.

### Restoring Using Cross-Region Replication (CRR)

Use CRR when you need to recover data from a replicated bucket in a different region due to a regional outage or disaster.

#### How to Restore

* Navigate to the destination bucket in the secondary region.
* Access the replicated objects from the CRR-enabled bucket.
* Download the necessary objects or replicate them back to the primary region as needed.
  
**RTO**: Immediate to a few hours, depending on the size of the data and replication status.

**Limitations**: Replication is asynchronous; there could be slight delays in data replication across regions.

### Restoring Using AWS Backup

Use AWS Backup to restore an entire S3 bucket or specific objects in case of accidental deletion, data corruption, or disaster recovery.

#### How to Restore

* Open the **AWS Backup** console and navigate to **Protected Resources**.
* Find the S3 bucket backup you want to restore.
* Click **Restore**, and specify the bucket or object you want to restore.
* Optionally, choose a different bucket for the restore location.

**RTO**: Typically within **minutes to hours**, depending on the size and number of objects being restored.
**Limitations**: Full restoration may take longer for very large datasets.

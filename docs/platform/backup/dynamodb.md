# DynamoDB Backup Strategy

## Overview

FormKiQ's backup strategy ensures data durability and business continuity through multiple backup mechanisms. Your specific backup implementation should align with your organization's:
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- Regulatory requirements
- Data retention policies

## Default Protection: Point-in-Time Recovery

FormKiQ enables Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) by default for all document-related DynamoDB tables. This provides:
- Continuous backup coverage
- 35-day recovery window
- Protection against accidental modifications
- Quick recovery from data corruption

## Additional Backup Options

### 1. On-Demand Backups

Create complete table snapshots that persist until explicitly deleted.

**Best For:**
- Pre-deployment safeguards
- Schema migration protection
- Long-term retention (beyond 35 days)
- Compliance requirements
- Stable recovery points

**Implementation:**
- Use AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDK
- Automate with AWS Lambda or AWS Backup
- Typical retention: 90 days
- Schedule around significant system changes

### 2. AWS Backup Integration

Centralized backup management across AWS services.

**Best For:**
- Multi-resource environments
- Cross-region redundancy
- Cross-account protection
- Compliance automation
- Unified backup management

**Implementation:**
- Define backup plans
- Configure cross-region replication
- Set retention policies
- Automate lifecycle management

### 3. Amazon S3 Export

Export table data for long-term archival and analysis.

**Best For:**
- Extended archival needs
- Compliance reporting
- Data analysis requirements
- Third-party integrations
- Cost-effective storage

**Implementation:**
- Use DynamoDB's Export to S3 feature
- Schedule regular exports (e.g., monthly)
- Configure S3 lifecycle policies
- Enable integration with analytics tools

## Recovery Procedures

### Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)

**Use Case:** Recent data recovery (within 35 days)

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to DynamoDB in AWS Console
2. Select target table
3. Choose Actions â†’ Restore Table to Point in Time
4. Specify restoration timestamp
5. Confirm new table creation

**Limitations:**
- 35-day recovery window
- Creates new table

### On-Demand Backup Recovery

**Use Case:** Long-term recovery points

**Steps:**
1. Access DynamoDB Backups
2. Select backup snapshot
3. Initialize restore operation
4. Specify new table name
5. Monitor restoration progress

**Limitations:**
- Fixed to backup timestamp
- Creates new table

### AWS Backup Recovery

**Use Case:** Cross-region/account recovery

**Steps:**
1. Open AWS Backup console
2. Locate DynamoDB resource
3. Select backup plan/point
4. Configure restoration settings
5. Initiate recovery

**Limitations:**
- Requires proper IAM permissions
- May involve cross-region data transfer

### S3 Export Recovery

**Use Case:** Historical data access

**Steps:**
1. Locate S3 export bucket
2. Retrieve exported files
3. Process data as needed:
   - Direct analysis
   - DynamoDB re-import
   - Third-party tool integration

**Limitations:**
- Requires ETL for DynamoDB re-import
- Not a direct restoration method

## Best Practices

1. **Strategy Alignment**
   - Match backup methods to business needs
   - Consider compliance requirements
   - Balance cost vs. recovery speed

2. **Regular Testing**
   - Validate backup integrity
   - Practice recovery procedures
   - Document recovery times

3. **Monitoring**
   - Track backup success/failure
   - Monitor storage costs
   - Review retention policies

4. **Documentation**
   - Maintain recovery procedures
   - Record configuration changes
   - Document backup schedule

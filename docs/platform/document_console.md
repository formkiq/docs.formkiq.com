  - SSL/TLS encryption

- **Amazon S3**: Storage backend containing:

  - Configuration files

:::note
CloudFront is not available in certain AWS regions (e.g., **AWS GovCloud (US) West**). For these regions, use the Docker deployment option below.

### Docker Deployment

For environments where CloudFront isn't available, FormKiQ provides an official [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/formkiq/document-console).

#### Prerequisites
Collect the following CloudFormation outputs from your FormKiQ installation:

![Document Console CloudFormation Outputs](./img/document-console-cf-outputs.png)

| Environment Variable | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `HTTP_API_URL` | API endpoint using Cognito authorization |
| `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` | Cognito User Pool identifier |
| `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` | Cognito Client identifier |
| `COGNITO_API_URL` | Cognito Login API endpoint |

#### Launch Command
```bash
docker run -p 80:80 \
  -e HTTP_API_URL=... \
  -e COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=... \
  -e COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=... \
  -e COGNITO_API_URL=... \
  formkiq/document-console:VERSION
```

## Initial Setup

In environments like AWS GovCloud (US) West where automatic setup isn't available, you'll need to:
1. Deploy the console using Docker
2. Configure the welcome email
3. Create the initial admin user

### Configuring Welcome Email

1. Locate the CognitoCustomMessage Lambda function:

2. Navigate to Configuration â†’ Environment Variables:

3. Set the `REDIRECT_URI` environment variable:
   - For local deployment: `http://localhost`
   - For EC2 deployment: Your EC2 instance URL

### Creating Initial Admin User

1. Follow the instructions in the [API Security section](/docs/platform/api_security#add-user-to-site) to create your first user
2. The user will receive a welcome email with a password setup link
3. After setting the password, this user can access the console and create additional users

## Customization

The FormKiQ Document Console is open source. You can find the source code and contribution guidelines on [GitHub](https://github.com/formkiq/formkiq-document-console).

:::note
While JWT and console authentication require at least one Cognito user, you can also use AWS IAM authentication or API key-based authentication for programmatic access.

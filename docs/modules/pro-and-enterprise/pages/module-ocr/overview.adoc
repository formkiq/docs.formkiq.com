Overview
~~~~~~~~

Document OCR is a FormKiQ  Module that provides optical character recognition (OCR) for the extraction of text and structured table or form data from documents.

The module uses https://aws.amazon.com/textract[Amazon Textract] as its OCR engine. Amazon Textract uses advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify, understand, and extract text and data from documents, including from forms and tables.

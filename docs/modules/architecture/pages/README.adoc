== Overview

FormKiQ is an API-first document management platform that can run in any https://aws.amazon.com[Amazon Web Services (AWS)^] account.

Document management is at the core of most organizations, with numerous documents that need to be stored, tracked, managed and organized. FormKiQ strives to be the most flexible, customizable and cost-effective document management system available.

FormKiQ's flexibility and customizability comes from its API-first design. All document management functionality (CRUD) is exposed through a robust set of APIs. This allows anyone to quickly and easily to add document management functionality to any application and cut months off of development time, while the FormKiQ Console enables organizations to have a full-featured document management system with as little or as much customization as they need.

FormKiQ was built to run in any AWS account. This ensures that you maintain full control of your documents 100% of the time.

== Database

FormKiQ uses https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb[Amazon DynamoDB] as the database for storing document data. DynamoDB provides fast, flexible NoSQL database service for single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. It is also fully-managed by AWS, so there are no database servers to manage.

FormKiQ uses a few different DynamoDB tables to store its data. FormKiQ for the most part uses a https://www.alexdebrie.com/posts/dynamodb-single-table[single table design]. Because all of the data is stored in a single table, querying and retrieving data is simplified, as there is no need to join multiple tables together. A single table design also allows for more efficient and flexible data access, as well as easier scalability and lower costs.

Multiple DynamoDB tables are used in situations where data can get stale or out dated and there needs to be data archival implemented.

=== Documents

The `documents` tables stores document records along with all metadata.

NOTE: If siteId is used the `PK` is prefix with "{siteId}/"

| `SK` | syncs#{yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ}#{UUID}
|=======================================================================

=== Data Caching

The data caching table is a table for temporary holding of data.

== Storage

FormKiQ uses the https://aws.amazon.com/s3/[Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)] as the backend object store for all documents. Amazon S3 is a manage object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

Amazon S3 is a cost-effective storage solution that's easy-to-use, supports multiple storage classes for cost optimization, and allows for fine-tuned access controls to meet specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.

By default FormKiQ installs with `two` S3 buckets.

|=======================================================================
| Bucket | Description
| `Staging` | A temporary holding place for documents waiting for processing
| `Documents` | The permanent post-processing document storage
|=======================================================================

=== Path Layout

FormKiQ is a multi-tenant application, so a specific S3 key structure is used to identify which tenant owns the document.

*Documents added to ROOT*

Any documents that are added to the "ROOT" of the S3 bucket, e.g. a document with S3 key of `document1.txt`, are assumed to be part of the `DEFAULT` siteId.

Documents can also be added to the `DEFAULT` siteId if the key starts with `default`, e.g. S3 key of `default/document1.txt`.

*Documents added to SiteId*

Documents can be added to a specific siteId by having that siteId as the first "folder" of they key, e.g. S3 key of `group1/document1.txt` will add the document1.txt to the `group1` siteId.

*Documents with a PATH*

As of version 1.7.0, documents can be added and have a `path` tag automatically created. Following the same pattern as above *EXCEPT* the S3 key *MUST* start with either `default` or the `siteId` path.

For examples:

S3 key of `default/dir1/dir2/document1.txt` will add a document with a `path` tag of `dir1/dir2/document1.txt` to the `default` siteId.

S3 key of `group1/dir1/dir2/document2.txt` will add a document with a `path` tag of `dir1/dir2/document2.txt` to the `group1` siteId.


=== Add Document Workflow

image::architecture_s3.png[S3 Architecture,800,800]

Documents can be added to S3 via the FormKiQ API or directly to the `Staging` S3 bucket. While it is recommended to only use the API for your standard workflow, it can be advantageous to add documents directly to the `Staging` S3 bucket, for operations such as initial document migration.

When a document is added to the `Staging` S3 bucket, an S3 object create event is created that calls the Document Create https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/[AWS Lambda]. The Document Create Lambda writes a record to https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/[Amazon DynamoDB], and moves the document to the `Documents` S3 bucket.

Once the document is added to the `Documents` S3 bucket, another S3 event is created which adds a message to the Update Document https://aws.amazon.com/sqs[Amazon SQS queue]. An Update Document Lambda is listening to the Update Document SQS queue and adds and updates document metadata whenever an event is added to the queue. Any S3 object tags that have been specified will also be included as document metadata.

NOTE: Each time a document is create or updated the AWS Lambda function also posts a message to https://aws.amazon.com/sns[Amazon Simple Notification Service], which can be used to trigger additional document processing.

=== FKB64 File Format

For initial document migration or other occasional uses, the `Staging` S3 bucket does allow direct uploads using a internal file format.

WARNING: Writing files directly to the `Documents` S3 bucket (i.e., not the `Staging` bucket) is *NOT* supported and may cause stability issues.

As of version 1.7.0, you can use the link:#s3-layout[S3 Layout] describe above if the S3 key ends in `.fkb64`

For example creating the following JSON and saving it as `document1.fkb64` in the ROOT of the `Staging` bucket will add the `content` field as a document in the `default` siteId.

Required fields are marked below.

----
{
  "path": "document1.txt",
  "userId": "joesmith", // <required>
  "contentType": "text/plain", // <required>
  "isBase64": true, // <required>
  "content": "dGhpcyBpcyBhIHRlc3Q=", // <required>
  "tags": [
    {
      "key": "category",
      "value": "document"
    },
    {
      "key": "user",
      "values": ["1", "2"]
    }
  ],
  "metadata": [
    {
      "key": "property1",
      "value": "value1"
    }
  ]
}
----

Note: The `.fkb64` matches the xref:api:README.adoc#AddDocumentRequest[Add Document Request]. Refer to the API for a listing of all properties.

== API

The API is built using https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway[Amazon API Gateway]. Amazon API Gateway is a fully-managed service that handles all of the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, and monitoring.

FormKiQ deploys with two APIs. One API is deployed with JWT authentication using https://aws.amazon.com/cognito[Amazon Cognito] as the JWT authorizer.

A second identical API is deployed using https://aws.amazon.com/iam[AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)].

The JWT-authenticated API is great for handling users requests, while the IAM-authenticated API is great for machine-to-machine or backend processing.

NOTE: All endpoints require either Cognito / IAM Authentication unless the URL starts with /public; the /public endpoint can be used to allow publicly-submitted documents such as web forms.

== Services

The following is a list of external or 3rd party services FormKiQ uses.

=== Typesense

image::architecture_typesense.png[Typesense Architecture,600,600]

https://typesense.org[Typesense] is an open source search solution and can be used a replacement for https://www.elastic.co[Elastic search]. FormKiQ uses it to provide fulltext search ability for document metadata.

FormKiQ uses https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html[change data capture for DynamoDB] to recorder all data changes in https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb[DynamoDB] and then update https://typesense.org[Typesense].

== Document Events

Document events are a powerful feature of FormKiQ. These events allow operations to be triggered on documents automatically, whenever a change occurs. For example, when a document is created, a document event can be triggered to perform one or many actions, such as:

- sending an email notification
- scanning for viruses
- inserting data into a database
- etc.

Document event are created and sent through https://aws.amazon.com/sns[Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)]. Amazon SNS is a messaging service that can be used for application-to-application communication. FormKiQ uses it as a publish/subscribe service, where applications can listen to the SNS service and be notified about different document events.

FormKiQ creates a single `SnsDocumentEvent` topic where all document events are sent. You can then use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-subscription-filter-policies.html[Amazon SNS subscription filter policies] to set up actions for a specific type of event.

FormKiQ provides the following message attributes that you can filter on:

|=======================================================================
| Message Attribute | Possible Value(s) | Description
| `type` | create, delete, update | Document Event(s) for create, update, or delete document
| `siteId` | default, (custom siteId) | Site Tenant Document Event was created in
|=======================================================================

See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-subscription-filter-policies.html

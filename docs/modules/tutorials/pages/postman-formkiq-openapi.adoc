= Using Postman and FormKiQ API

This tutorial will take you through setting up the FormKiQ API inside of https://www.postman.com[Postman^].

## Prerequisite

* You have installed FormKiQ; see the xref:quickstart:README.adoc#one-click-installation-links[FormKiQ One-Click Installation Links] for more information
* You have installed https://www.postman.com[Postman^].
* You have a FormKiQ Access Token xref:how-to:jwt-authentication-token.adoc[Getting Cognito JWT Access Token tutorial]

## CloudFormation Outputs

We are going to need to know the name of a few AWS resources creating during the FormKiQ installation. Opening the https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation[CloudFormation console^], find your FormKiQ stack and click the `Outputs` tab.

## FormKiQ API Specification

FormKiQ's API is built using the https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html[OpenAPI Specification^], which is an open standard for defining APIs.

The FormKiQ API specification can be found in the https://github.com/formkiq/formkiq-core[FormKiQ Core^] Github repository, called `openapi-jwt.yaml`.

## Import FormKiQ API

Open https://www.postman.com[Postman^] and select `File` -> `Import`.

Select the `Link` tab and use the following URL for the FormKiQ API specification.

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formkiq/formkiq-core/master/docs/openapi/openapi-jwt.yaml`

## Configure Postman Variables

Postman has imported the FormKiQ API, the next step is to set the variables to our FormKiQ installation.

To set the FormKiQ API variables, select the `three dots` next to the `FormKiQ HTTP API` and click `Edit`.

Next, set the `baseUrl` variable to the `HttpApiUrl` CloudFormation Output variable.

Then create a new `token` variable and set the value to your JWT AccessToken.

## Execute FormKiQ API

You are now ready to execute a FormKiQ API. If you are executing a FormKiQ API that requires authentication. Ensure, you set the `Access Token` to `{{token}}` which will use the variable we configured above when sending the request.

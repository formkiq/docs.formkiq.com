== What is FormKiQ

FormKiQ is a API-first, highly scalable document management system built on top on top of the latest in https://aws.amazon.com[Amazon Web Services(AWS)] infrastructure and technology.

The API-first design allows anyone to quickly and easily to add document management functionality to any application and cut months off of development time. Or with FormKiQ's Web UI, it can be used as a fully-featured stand-alone application.

FormKiQ has been designed using a "headless" architecture principles. This means that the Web UI is completely decoupled from the backend API. This means that you can use your current UI to integrate with FormKiQ or you can build your own UI from scratch using our React Web UI as a reference.

FormKiQ is built to scale for any use case. It can be used by the largest corportation to the smallest team. FormKiQ uses serverless technology so you only pay for what you use.

FormKiQ is an https://github.com/formkiq/formkiq-core[Open Core] product. Where the core functionality is made available through an Open Source license. Additional document management function and modules and support are available from https://formkiq.com.

== Document Features

FormKiQ is a fully-featured document management system, that leverages the infrastructure and services of AWS to make it all possible.

=== Document Tags

A document tag is a key / value(s) pair assigned to a document in order to label or identify it. These document tags can then be used in a tag search to be able to quickly find the documents. FormKiQ supports adding an unlimited number of tag(s) to a document.

NOTE: When using document versioning, a document tag(s) are NOT versioned.

=== Document Metadata

Document metadata is a custom data a user can attached to a document. Unlike a document tag, metadata can only be searched when using one of FormKiQ's full-text solutions (https://typesense.org/[Typesense] / https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service[OpenSearch]). Each document only support up to 25 Metadata entries.

NOTE: When using document versioning, a document metadata ARE versioned.

=== Document Actions

FormKiQ's document actions allow you to create processes the document will perform when it is created.

For example with document actions you could:
- Have a WEBHOOK called when a document is created
- Automatically OCR a document and send it to https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service[OpenSearch]
- Automatically scan a document for viruses

=== Document Events

FormKiq is built using a message driven architecture. This means you can be notified on when different events happen.

For example you can subscribe to FormKiQ's document event https://aws.amazon.com/sns[Amazon SNS] topic and be notified when a document is create, updated or deleted. This makes it simple to extend FormKiQ functionality to mean your needs.

=== Document Searching

Out-of-the-box FormKiQ uses https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb[Amazon DynamoDB] for performing document tag searches. Multi-tag searching is supported when used in combination with the xref:enterprise:module-tagschema/overview.adoc[FormKiQ TagSchema].

Document metadata and full text searching is support through https://typesense.org/[Typesense] or https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service[OpenSearch].

== Multi-Tenant and Multi-Instance

FormKiQ Core supports usage as a multi-tenant application. This can be used for internal departments or teams, or for external clients. During deployment, a "default" SiteId is created; all documents are stored in that tenant by default.

To create another SiteId is as simple as adding a new https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-user-groups.html[Cognito group to the user pool]

Creating a Cognito Group with the same name as the SiteId but ending in "_read" will create a read-only group. The users in this group will have read-only access to documents within that SiteId.

Each API request has an optional "SiteId" parameter to specify which SiteId you would like to use.

NOTE: This parameter is only needed if a user belongs to multiple SiteIds or if the user is in the "Admins" Group (full access) and wants to perform an operation in a SiteId other than "default". This allows groups such as external clients to access documents without requiring knowledge of their SiteId.

== API Overview

FormKiQ has a robust, battle tested, document management API. FormKiQ deploys with 2 APIs, one that uses JWT authentication and one that uses https://aws.amazon.com/iam[AWS IAM]. This allows the ulimate in flexibility for supporting users access as well as backend system access.

FormKiQ API was built on top of https://www.openapis.org[OpenAPI specification] so it is easy to use the API spec file with any application that supports the OpenAPI specification.

xref:api:README.adoc[FormKiQ API]

== Enterprise Features

FormKiQ supports a wide array of enterprise modules and features. See xref:enterprise:README.adoc[List of Enterprise Modules]

== AWS Costs

FormKiQ was created using [serverless technology](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/). This means that there are no servers to manage; everything is managed by AWS. All AWS services FormKiQ uses pay-per-usage billing. You can start using FormKiQ with very little cost.

AWS provides a [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free) to all AWS accounts. This means that some AWS services you can use for **free** pending you stay under the usage limits. Below is the list of services FormKiQ uses and their approximate usage costs, so give you an idea on how much it costs to run FormKiQ. (All costs in USD)

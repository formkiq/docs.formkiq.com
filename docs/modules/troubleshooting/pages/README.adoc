== *{"message":"Internal Server Error"}*

After installing FormKiQ, the API returns an "Internal server error" and a 500 status code. How do I resolve the error?

[float]
=== *Short description*

In rare circumstances, API Gateway's auto deployment silently fails, this causes https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway[AWS API Gateway] to be disconnected from the FormKiQ backend.

=== *Resolution*

There are two solutions:

. Delete the FormKiQ CloudFormation Stack and run the installation process again.

*OR*

. Force the API Gateway to redeploy, using the following steps:

Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway[API Gateway Console] from your https://console.aws.amazon.com[AWS Console] (make sure you switch to the correct AWS Region).

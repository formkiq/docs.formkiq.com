The FormKiQ Custom Domains Module is a module for the FormKiQ Headless Document Management System that enables full encryption for the AWS services used by FormKiQ.

The module uses the https://aws.amazon.com/kms[AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)] service to create and manage cryptographic keys and control the use of the keys. AWS KMS integrates with all the services used by FormKiQ:

* https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb[Amazon DynamoDB]

* https://aws.amazon.com/s3[Amazon S3]

* https://aws.amazon.com/sqs[Amazon Simple Queue Service]

* https://aws.amazon.com/sqs[Amazon Simple Queue Service]

* https://aws.amazon.com/sns[Amazon Simple Notification Service]

AWS KMS integrates with AWS CloudTrail, a service that delivers log files to your designated Amazon S3 bucket. By using CloudTrail you can monitor and investigate how and when your KMS keys have been used and who used them.

The FormKiQ Single Sign-On and Custom JWT Authorizer Module is a module for the FormKiQ Headless Document Management System that enables the ability to customize the authorizer used for FormKiQ console, and API endpoints. FormKiQ by default uses https://aws.amazon.com/cognito[Amazon Cognito] as the JWT authorizer.

Using this module the authorizer can be changed to another authorizer such as:

* Another JWT authorizer such as https://auth0.com[Auth0]

* SAML identity providers through Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0)

* Public providers: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/facebook.html[FaceBook], https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/google.html[Google], or https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/apple.html[Apple]

* OpenID Connect provider

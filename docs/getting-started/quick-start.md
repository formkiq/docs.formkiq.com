## Prerequisites

For this quickstart you will need access to an AWS account with administrator access to ensure proper permissions for creating required AWS services.

If you do not have a AWS account, you can sign up for one at https://aws.amazon.com.

### AWS Lambda Concurrent Executions

Concurrent executions refer to the number of function invocations being handled simultaneously. [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda) defaults to **10** concurrent executions per region. Request an increase to **1000** before installation.

#### Check Concurrent Executions

![Open CloudShell](./img/cloudshell.png)

Run **aws cli** command:

```bash
aws service-quotas get-service-quota --service-code lambda \
--quota-code L-B99A9384 --region <AWS_REGION>
```

Resulting **Value** shows the AWS Lambda Concurrent executions.

```json
{
    "Quota": {
        "ServiceCode": "lambda",
        "ServiceName": "AWS Lambda",
        "QuotaCode": "L-B99A9384",
        "QuotaName": "Concurrent executions",
        "Value": 1000.0,
        "Unit": "None",
        ...
    }
}
```

:::note
Request this increase for each region where you'll deploy FormKiQ.
:::

### Create CloudFormation Stack

After selecting your VPC installation link and logging in, you'll see the CloudFormation Create Stack console with the pre-populated FormKiQ VPC installation URL.

![CloudFormation Create Stack](./img/cf-createstack-vpc.png)

Click the **Next** button to move to the next page.

### Set Stack Name

The stack name uniquely identifies your FormKiQ VPC deployment within AWS CloudFormation. 

We recommended to use the naming convention **formkiq-vpc**.

![CloudFormation VPC Stack Name](./img/cf-create-parameters-vpc-stack-name.png)

### Installation Parameters

The following is description of the VPC installation parameters:

![CloudFormation Stack Parameters](./img/cf-create-vpc-stack-parameters.png)

#### **EnableEnterpriseFeatures**:

If you are using OpenSearch, you need to enable enterprise features, which automatically setups VPC endpoints.

:::note
This is not required for FormKiQ Core.
:::

#### **CIDR Ranges**:

The VPC sets up 3 public, and 3 private subnets.

When creating the VPC, you need to specify an IPv4 network range for the VPC, in CIDR notation. For example, 10.1.0.0/16.

:::note
We recommend choosing a CIDR block that you know is not being used by any existing AWS resources in your AWS Organization. Ideally, each AWS account (one for each environment) is using its own CIDR range, e.g., 10.10.0.0/16 for dev, 10.20.0.0/16 for test/qa, etc.
:::

#### **VpcLabel**:

The label added to the created VPC. This will be visible in the AWS Management Console when viewing your VPCs, and will help identify this VPC in future.

### Configure stack options

Scroll down to the bottom of the page, select **ALL** the checkboxes.

![Setup Stack Options](./img/cf-create-stack-options.png)

Click the **Next** button to move to the next page.

### Review and create

Scroll down to the bottom.

![Setup Stack Options](./img/cf-create-stack-review-and-create.png)

Click the **Submit** button to start the VPC installation.

:::info
Once the installation has completed, you will need to attach this Stack to your FormKiQ installation, by updating the **VpcStackName** parameter.
:::

## Update FormKiQ

**This step is essential in order to enable access to Typesense or OpenSearch**

After creating the VPC stack, the main FormKiQ CloudFormation stack needs to be updated. Select the FormKiQ CloudFormation stack and then click the **Update** button.

When updating the stack you will want to choose **Use existing template**.

![CloudFormation Update Stack](./img/cf-updatestack.png)

For the **VpcStackName** parameter, set the value to the same value you used for the VPC stack you created above; in our example, it was **formkiq-vpc**.


![Set VPC Stack Name](./img/cf-create-parameter-vpc-stackname.png)

Click the **Next** button to move to the next pages. On the last page click the **Submit** button to update the FormKiQ stack. After the Stack completes updating, the FormKiQ installation will have the VPC features enabled.

## Install with SAM CLI

FormKiQ Core was built using the [AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) framework.

The Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) is an extension of the AWS CLI that adds functionality for deploying serverless applications.

### Prerequisite

To use SAM CLI, you will need to install the following tools:

* AWS CLI - Install the AWS CLI (https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* SAM CLI - Install the SAM CLI (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)

### Get Latest Release

The latest version of FormKiQ Core can be found on the https://github.com/formkiq/formkiq-core/releases page on Github.

Download the file with the naming convention of: `formkiq-core-X.X.X.zip`

Once downloaded, unzip the file in its own directory.

```

```

The command will package and deploy your application to AWS, with a series of prompts:

| Argument | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| **Stack Name** | The name of the stack to deploy to CloudFormation. This should be unique to your account and region | formkiq-core-&lt;AppEnvironment&gt; |
| **AdminEmail** | Set the admin email address. During the FormKiQ installation, this email address will be automatically set up with administrator access. |
| **AppEnvironment** | AppEnvironment is a unique identifier for FormKiQ installations. The identifier should provider context to what kind of information is contained in the installation, IE: prod, staging, dev. | prod |
| **EnablePublicUrls** | Whether to enable "/public" endpoints. | false
| **PasswordMinimumLength** | Minimum Password Length | 8
| **PasswordRequireLowercase** | Whether Password requires a lowercase letter | false
| **PasswordRequireNumbers** | Whether Password requires a number | false
| **PasswordRequireSymbols** | Whether Password requires a symbol | false
| **PasswordRequireUppercase** | Whether Password requires a uppercase letter | false
| **VpcStackName** | Optional: The name of the FormKiQ VPC CloudFormation stack | null

| **CapacityProvider** | Optional: CapacityProvider used by AWS Fargate service | FARGATE_SPOT


* **Confirm changes before deploy**: If set to yes, any change sets will be shown to you before execution for manual review. If set to no, the AWS SAM CLI will automatically deploy application changes.
* **Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation**: FormKiQ Core's AWS SAM templates create AWS IAM roles required for the AWS Lambda function(s) included to access AWS services. The permissions are passed in by the `sam deploy` command above. Set Value to 'Y'
* **Save arguments to samconfig.toml**: If set to yes, your choices will be saved to a configuration file inside the project, so that in the future you can just re-run `sam deploy` without parameters to deploy changes to your application.

Once you have set all of these options, SAM CLI will create a changeset and will display a list of all actions that will be performed as part of the changeset. If you have set "confirm changes before deploy" to "y", you will then be asked whether or nor to deploy this changeset. Choose "y" to complete the installation.

Once the FormKiQ Core stack has been deployed, you will be able to find your API Gateway Endpoint URL in the output values displayed after deployment.

### FormKiQ Console for AWS GovCloud (US)

Due to restrictions related to AWS GovCloud (US) and the lack of CloudFront availability, the FormKiQ Document Console is not installed as part of the deployment. Instead, you can deploy a docker image into GovCloud for internal or external access. [More information can be found here](/docs/platform/document_console#docker-image).

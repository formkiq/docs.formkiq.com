# Documents

```
API Endpoint: /documents
```

At the heart of the FormKiQ document management platform lies a sophisticated framework that seamlessly integrates storing, retrieving, and organizing documents. Our platform's robust storage capabilities ensure documents are securely housed and easily retrievable, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Amazon S3 to guarantee data integrity and scalability. 

Documents can be organized in a way that mirrors their workflow, projects, or departments. This intuitive hierarchy ensures efficient navigation, as documents are logically grouped for swift access. Users can effortlessly retrieve specific files by browsing through familiar folder paths or by utilizing powerful search functionalities. This combination of advanced storage solutions and user-centric organization not only streamlines document management but also enhances collaboration and knowledge sharing across teams. Our platform transforms document handling into a seamless and structured process, offering a comprehensive solution for businesses seeking to optimize their document management practices.

## Metadata

FormKiQ has several types of metadata currently, separated into different resources:

### Standard

Standard document metadata: common metadata such as the path/filename, content type, checksum, and filesize, and one use-specific property, deepLinkPath, enabling an external documentâ€™s metadata to be included within FormKiQ while the file object itself is stored in another system.

### Attributes

```
API Endpoint: /documents/{documentId}/attributes
```

FormKiQ's document management platform revolutionizes the way documents are organized and retrieved by offering a robust document organizing capability through document attributes.

see [Attributes](/docs/features/attributes) for more details.

### Tags (Replace by Attributes)

```
API Endpoint: /documents/{documentId}/tags
```

FormKiQ's tagging feature, documents can be meticulously labeled using a variety of options: 

* a standalone key for broad categorization
* a key paired with a value for detailed classification
* or a key associated with multiple values for comprehensive tagging. 

This flexibility empowers users to tailor their tagging approach according to their specific needs, enhancing document discovery and navigation. Through tags, documents become rich with context, allowing users to quickly identify relevant materials and establish meaningful connections between files. Whether it's a simple keyword, an intricate set of attributes, or a combination of both, our platform's tagging functionality ensures documents are intelligently categorized and readily accessible, fostering a dynamic and user-centric document management experience.

### Document Metadata

Document metadata is custom data that can be directly attach to a document. By embedding metadata within the document, users ensure that essential information remains intact and travels alongside the document, enhancing its context and discoverability.

When using document versioning, as documents evolve and new versions are created, the platform retains a historical record of metadata changes, providing a comprehensive history of the document's attributes across iterations. This powerful feature allows for the fosters accurate tracking and auditing for document controls.

Unlike a document tag (which is unversioned), metadata can only be searched when using one of FormKiQ's full-text solutions. Each document only support up to 25 Metadata entries.

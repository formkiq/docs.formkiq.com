# Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

## Optical Character Recognition

The FormKiQ platform empowers users to extract meaningful information from images or non-searchable PDFs, converting them into text that can be indexed, searched, and utilized.

[Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/) is AWS fully managed machine learning (ML) service that automatically extracts text, handwriting, and data from scanned documents (available in FormKiQ Pro/Enterprise).

[Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) is an open-source software tool developed by Google that is used to convert images containing printed or handwritten text into machine-readable text (available in FormKiQ Core/Pro/Enterprise).

# Google Workload Identity Federation

This tutorial show you how to setup [Google Workload Identity Federation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation) and connect it to your FormKiQ installation. This will enable FormKiQ access to your documents in your Google Drive.

We will be:

* Configuring a New Project in your Google Cloud account

* Enabling Workload Identity Federation in your Google account to give FormKiQ access to your Google documents.

* Configure FormKiQ 

## What youâ€™ll need

* Access to a FormKiQ Advanced or Enterprise installation, including administrative access

* Administrative access to a Google Cloud

## Pre-requisite

You will need these specific configuration values:

* AWS Account Id (12 digit number that uniquely identifies your account)

## Google Cloud

The following steps will create a FormKiQ Google Cloud project and setup a Workload Identity Federation that will give your FormKiQ installation access to your Google docs.

Visit [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com) and login as administrator

### Create new Google Cloud Project

At the top of the page select the project window and select **New Project**.

![New Google Cloud Project](./img/google-cloud-new-project.png)

### Configure New Project

Give your project a name and select the organization to place the project in and click **Create**.

![New Google Cloud Project](./img/google-cloud-create-project.png)

### Select Created Project

Select your project from the notification window.

![New Google Cloud Project](./img/google-cloud-select-project-notification.png)

Verify you are in your newly created project from the top menu.

## Configure Google Cloud Project

Now that your project is created, we will now configure the project to allow FormKiQ access usiing Workload Identity Federation.

### Enable API & Services

Using the search menu at the top. Search for **Enable API & Services**.

![Enable API & Services](./img/google-cloud-search-enable-api-services.png)

Click the **ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES** button.

![Enable API & Services](./img/google-cloud-enable-api-and-services.png)

Clicking the **ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES** button will bring you to the API Library. Search for the **Google Drive API**.

![Google Drive API](./img/google-cloud-drive-api.png)

Select the **Google Drive API** search result.

![Google Drive API search result](./img/google-cloud-drive-search.png)

Click the **Enable** button to enable the Google Drive API in this project.

## Workload Identity Federation

In this section we will use Google's [workload identity federation with other clouds](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-other-clouds) to connect the Google Cloud project we created above to our FormKiQ installation.

Start by visiting the [Workload Identity Federation with other clouds](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-other-clouds) documentation.

### Configure Workload Identity Federation

In the **Configure Workload Identity Federation** part of the documentation:

* Click the **Go to project selector** to make sure the correct project is selected.

* Click the **Enable the APIs** to enable the IAM, Resource Manager, Service Account Credentials, and Security Token Service APIs.

* Scroll down to the [Create the workload identity pool and provider](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-other-clouds#create_the_workload_identity_pool_and_provider) and click the **Go to New workload provider and pool**.

### New Workload Provider and Pool

To create a new Workload provider, give the workload a name and description and click **Continue**.

![Enable Google Drive API](./img/google-cloud-create-identity-pool.png)

Under Add a provider to pool, select **AWS** provider and give the provider a name and enter in your 12 digit AWS Account Id and click **Continue**.

![Add a provider to pool](./img/google-cloud-add-provider-pool.png)

Under **Configure provider attributes**, click the **Edit Mapping**.

The following are the suggested provider attributes configuration to use. The settings below will restrict access to the AWS account configured and to only AWS assumed roles.

| Google 1     | Aws 1  |
|----------|-----|
| google.subject    | assertion.arn     |

| Google 2     | Aws 2  |
|----------|-----|
| attribute.aws_role    | `assertion.arn.extract('assumed-role/{role}/')`     |

| Google 3     | Aws 3  |
|----------|-----|
| attribute.account    | assertion.account     |

![Configure Provider Attributes](./img/google-cloud-configure-provider-attributes.png)

## Service Account Impersonation

To provider FormKiQ with access to Google Cloud resources you need to setup a [service account impersonation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-other-clouds#impersonation).

Visit the [Service Account Impersonation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation-with-other-clouds#impersonation) page.

* Click the **Enable the APIs** to enable the IAM, Security Token Service, and Service Account Credentials APIs.

* Goto the [Create service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create?walkthrough_id=iam--create-service-account&_ga=2.242857538.1315701571.1722906016-1293649622.1720794182#step_index=1) page to setup a service account.

### Service account details

From the Service account details page, give the service account a name, account id and description. 

:::note
Record the Email address of the service account as it will be needed later.
:::

Then click **Create and Continue**.

![Service Account details](./img/google-cloud-service-account-details.png)

#### Grant this service account access to project

Under the Grant this service account access to project, give the service two roles.

* First role is "Basic" -> "Viewer"

* Second role is "Workload Identity User"

![Service Account Access](./img/google-cloud-service-account-access.png)

Click **Done** and the service account is configured.

### Workload Identity Federation

Select the **Workload Identity Federation** from the left menu of the IAM & Admin screen.

Select the pool listed and then click the **Grant Access** button.

#### Grant access to service account 

Under the **Grant access to service account**

* Select the **Grant access using Service Account impersonation** option

* Select the Service Account

* Set Attribute Name to **account**

* Set Attribute Value to your 12 digit AWS Account Id.

* Click **SAVE**

![Grant access to service account](./img/google-cloud-workload-identity-grant-access.png)

* Finally **Download Config** as this will be used to configure your FormKiQ installation.

## Summary

And there you have it! We have shown how easy it is to connect your Google drive to FormKiQ.

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to working with the FormKiQ APIs.

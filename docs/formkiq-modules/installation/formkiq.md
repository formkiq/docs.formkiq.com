![CloudFormation Create Stack](./img/cf-createstack.png)

### 3. Configure Stack Settings

#### Stack Name
- Format: `formkiq-<edition>-<environment>`
- Example: `formkiq-enterprise-prod`
- Allowed characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and hyphens (-)

:::tip Environment Separation
For production deployments, we recommend:
- Using [AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations)
- Creating separate AWS accounts for each environment (dev, test/qa, staging, production)
- This approach improves security and cost tracking
:::

#### Core Parameters
Review and configure the standard FormKiQ parameters as described in the [Quick Start Guide](/docs/getting-started/quick-start#set-admin-email).

#### Additional Parameters

##### Certificate Integration
```plaintext
Parameter: CertificateStackName
Description: Name of the deployed FormKiQ Certificate CloudFormation stack
Required: When using SSL certificates
```

##### OpenSearch Integration
```plaintext
Parameter: OpenSearchStackName
Description: Name of the deployed OpenSearch CloudFormation stack
Required: When using OpenSearch
Note: VpcStackName must also be specified with OpenSearch
```

### 4. Complete Installation

1. Review all configuration settings
2. Navigate through remaining CloudFormation screens
3. On the final page:
   - Review the acknowledgments
   - Check required boxes
   - Click "Submit" to create the stack

Multi-Tenant
------------

FormKiQ Core supports running as a multi-tenant application. This can be used for internal departments or teams, or for external clients. During deployment, a "default" SiteId is created; all documents are stored in that tenant by default.

To create another SiteId is as simple as adding a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-user-groups.html[Cognito group to the user pool]

Creating a Cognito Group with the same name as the SiteId but ending in "_read" will create a readonly group. The users in this group will have readonly access to that SiteId.

Each API requests has a "SiteId" parameter you can pass to specify which SiteId you would like to use.

**NOTE:** This parameter is only needed if a user belongs to multiple SiteIds or if the user is in the "Admins" Group (full access) and wants to perform an operation in a SiteId other than "default".

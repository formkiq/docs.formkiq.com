Webhooks
--------

Many services today allow you to uses webhooks to notify your application when an event happens in the service. For example, https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks[Stripe] allow you to specify a webhooks to notify your application when an event happens in your account.

With FormKiQ you can create webhook endpoints that you can use to receive and store event notifications from other services. Using the /webhooks API (or from the console), you can create a webhook and then enter that webhook in Stripe or other supporting services and immediately start receiving notifications.

FormKiQ allows you to take this one step further and using the link:#_document_events[Document Events] (that are created every time a webhook notification is received), you can easily write custom code that is automatically executed.

Webhooks
--------

Many services today allow you to uses webhooks to notify your application when an event happens within the service. For example, https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks[Stripe] allows you to specify webhooks to notify your application when a specific event happens within your Stripe account.

With FormKiQ Core, you can create webhook endpoints to receive and store event notifications from other services. Using the /webhooks API (or from the FormKiQ Console), you can create a webhook and then enter that webhook in Stripe or other supporting services to immediately start receiving notifications.

FormKiQ Core also allows you to take this one step further: using the link:#_document_events[Document Events] that are created every time a webhook notification is received, you can easily write custom code that is automatically executed.

==== API

The API is built using https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway[Amazon API Gateway]. Amazon API Gateway is a fully-managed service that handles all of the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, and monitoring.

FormKiQ deploys with two APIs. One API is deployed with JWT authentication using https://aws.amazon.com/cognito[Amazon Cognito] as the JWT authorizer.

A second identical API is deployed using https://aws.amazon.com/iam[AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)].

The JWT-authenticated API is great for handling users requests, while the IAM-authenticated API is great for machine-to-machine or backend processing.

*NOTE* All endpoints require either Cognito / IAM Authentication unless the URL starts with /public; the /public endpoint can be used to allow publicly-submitted documents such as web forms.

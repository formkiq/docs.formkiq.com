# API!

== API Overview

FormKiQ has a robust and battle-tested document management API. FormKiQ deploys with 2 APIs, one that uses JWT authentication and one that uses [AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam). This allows flexibility in supporting both user access and backend system access.

FormKiQ API was built on top of [OpenAPI specification](https://www.openapis.org), so it is easy to use the API spec file with any application that supports the OpenAPI specification.
